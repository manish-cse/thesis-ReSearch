# thesis-ReSearch
Work I did in my thesis.

#Thesis: Developed a system that retrieves relevant theses (from IITK theses repository) based not only on the syntactic information but also on the semantic information (using machine learning and information retrieval techniques). Also developed a system that finds similarity among the research interest of the professors of IIT-Kanpur.

Built a crawler to scrape theses sbmitted so far in IITK and maintained an sqlite3 database to store this dataset.

Software for this is live in IITK intranet, for demo purpose I have uploaded it in public domain.

Note: The above software is not the updated version and lacks many details. I am working on providing the latest version of the software as well as the code for all Machine Learning models I have used for this.
